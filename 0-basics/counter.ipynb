    "# Counter \n",
    "\n",
    "            The Counter class from the collections module in Python is a powerful tool for counting the occurrences of elements in an iterable. It can be used to tally items such as words in a text, characters in a string, or any other collection where counting is required.\n",
    "            Key Features of Counter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Initialization:`\n",
    "    + You can create a __Counter__ object by passing an iterable or by using keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Counting Elements:`\n",
    "    + The Counter automatically counts the frequency of each element in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Methods:`\n",
    "    + `elements()`: Returns an iterator over elements, repeating each as many times as its count.\n",
    "    + `most_common([n])`: Returns a list of the n most common elements and their counts.\n",
    "    + `subtract([iterable-or-mapping])`: Subtracts elements from the counter.\n",
    "    + `Arithmetic and set operations`: Supports addition, subtraction, intersection, and union.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples to illustrate how Counter works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `Initialization:` You can initialize a Counter with an iterable or keyword arguments, and it will count the occurrences of each element."
